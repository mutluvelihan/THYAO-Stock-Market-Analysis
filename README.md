The project generally aims to make predictions about the stocks of Turkish Airlines Company in the stock market. First of all, 20 years of data was recorded as the first transaction and holidays were removed from this data. Then, 5 models were used to make predictions on this data. These models are Informer, Reformer, TFT, Autoformer and TSFormer models. While some of these models gave good results, some did not get full efficiency. As a result, the project was tried to be solved.
